One of the most important aspect of managing a sales team is to be able to track the sales data, as an individual or as a team.

ChatMamba CRM provides the functionality out of the box, by presenting data in meaningful dashboard.

## Adding sales report

There are a few ways to add sales report to ChatMamba CRM, for both leads that are in or not in the system.

### Add report for lead in ChatMamba CRM

For leads that are already in ChatMamba, in **Lead Progress** View, click on the triangle located on the left of the lead, then click on **Sales Report**. Alternatively, change the **Status** of your lead to the state that is defined as "sales closed" by your organization.

Then, complete the sales data form by filling in Portion and Sales data. If there are more than 1 agent involve in the sales, you may also split the sales portion accordingly. This way, sales revenue can be calculated accurately for each agent.
