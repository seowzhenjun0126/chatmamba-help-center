> Starting 5th September 2020, ChatMamba will introduce its Premium Plan model. Pages that are not upgraded to Premium Plan will be set with usage quota. See the full article [here](https://help.chatmamba.com/en/article/pricing-plans#future-pricing-model).

As your page grows, you may require higher quota than our Free Plan can offer. This is when you might consider upgrading to our Premium Plan. Upgrading your Facebook Page unlocks the following benefits :

- Quota is calculated by month, instead of day (This can ensure your automation doesn't get limited in case of a sudden spike in usage)
- Higher quota. For full plan comparison, see here
- Remove watermark for Comment Autoreply

## How to upgrade your Facebook Page

1. Go to ChatMamba, and click on the Upgrade Button on the page you wish to upgrade.
2. In the upgrade page, select the plan combination that suits you.
3. Then, you can choose to be billed monthly or annually, view plan summary, and add discount coupon (if any).
4. Click the Checkout button. You will be directed to a secure checkout page hosted by Stripe (ChatMamba's payment service provider). Enter your payment details and finish the checkout.
5. Voila! You've completed the checkout process, and your page is upgraded immediately. You can verify that your page is upgraded to **Premium Plan** by the green badge beside your page name.
