After setting up Lead Extraction, you might want to test if everything is working as expected. You can do that:

- easily by using the Send Test Lead button in ChatMamba, or
- by sending test lead using the Facebook Lead Ads Testing tool

## Using ChatMamba

1. Go to [ChatMamba](https://chatmamba.com) -> Your Facebook Page -> Lead Extraction -> Linked Form
2. Click on the **Send Test Lead**

>[!note]
> Remember to save your settings before sending test lead. Only saved settings are used when extracting leads.

3. A generated fake lead will be shown. Click Send to create the fake lead.
4. That's it. You can now check your integrated apps to see if the lead is extracted.
5. You can also view the test lead you've sent to make sure the data is extracted correctly. Click on View Test Lead (only avaialble after sending test lead) beside the Send Test Lead button.

## Using Facebook Lead Ads Testing tool

1. Go to Lead Ads Testing Tool.
2. Select the Facebook Page and Leadgen Form that you want to test.
3. Click Preview Form to edit test lead details.
4. Submit the test lead.

>[!tip]
> If you wish to send another test lead from the same Leadgen Form, you have to Delete Lead before sending.

## Verify Lead Extraction Functionality

After submitting, check that:

- You have a new row written to Google Spreadsheet that you've linked to, with the details from the preview
- You receive an email about the new lead in your mail box (if you've set up email notifications)
