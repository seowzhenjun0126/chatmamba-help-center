## Change your Premium Plan

At any time, you can change your Premium Plan according to your needs.

For example, you may have subscribed to the Comment Autoreply **Premium Plan** together with Lead Extraction **Free Plan**, and would like to upgrade your Lead Extraction to **Premium Plan** after that.

To change your Premium Plan :

1. Go to [Subscriptions & billing](https://chatmamba.com/settings/billing) page
2. On the right hand side of the page you wish to unsubscribe, click the action button. Then, click **Upgrade subscription**

3. You will be directed to the pricing plan page. Here, you can select the Premium Plan combination that suits your need.
4. After selecting your plan, you will be directed to checkout page. here you can :
  a. Select if you want to be billed monthly or annually
  b. View summary of the upgrade
  c. Apply a discount coupon (if any)

>[!tip]
> Select annual billing and save 16% annually

5. Sometimes, you might notice that the total of the upgrade price is negative. This means that you are actually downgrading your plan. ChatMamba will prorate your plan at the time you change it.

>[!example]
> If you subscribed to ChatMamba **Premium Annual Plan** (RM180 per year) and downgrade to ChatMamba **Premium Monthly Plan** (RM18 per month) 1 month later, you will see that the total of the change is RM18 - RM180 = -RM162, which corresponds to the **credit for unused time** on the Premium Annual Plan.

6. The unused credit will be stored in your account, and used to pay any future invoice from your account. Continuing the above example, you will not be charged until the RM162 in your account is used up.

## Cancel your Premium Plan

>[!note]
> Your Premium Plan will remain active until the end of the current subscription or trial period.

To cancel your Premium Plan :

1. Go to [Subscriptions & billing](https://chatmamba.com/settings/billing) page

3. When you cancel your subscription, ChatMamba will stop renewing the subscription and change the page to Free Plan when the subscription or trial period ends.
