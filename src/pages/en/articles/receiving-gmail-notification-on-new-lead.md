> This article is about receving notification on Gmail.

Sometimes, emails that are sent by ChatMamba falls into categories (Promotions, Spam, etc.) that do not trigger notification on your mobile phone, and you may not get notified on new incoming lead.

To overcome this problem, you will have to set up a custom filter to tell Gmail that these emails are important.

## Setting up Gmail filter

1. Go to [Gmail](https://gmail.com/).
2. In the search box at the top, click the Down arrow.
3. Enter the search criteria as shown in below :
    - In the 'From' field, enter '*@chatmamba.com'.
    - In the 'Has the words' field, enter 'lead'.
4. Click 'Create filter'.

### Set up rule for the filter

1. You have just created a custom filter that filter any incoming email from chatmamba.com that has the word 'lead'. Now, you want to do something when this criteria is met.
2. Follow the settings below to set up rule that does the following :
    - Apply the 'Lead' label to the email (You will have to create the label)
    - Do not send the email to Spam
    - Mark the email as important
    - Categorize it as Primary
3. With the settings above, you can make sure that you will receive notification on all incoming lead.
4. You also label all these email with the label you've created above (in this case the label is 'Lead').

### Set label color

You may also give this label a color so that it can be easily recognize in your inbox, as shown in below.
