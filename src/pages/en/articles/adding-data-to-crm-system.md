There are 3 ways to add data to ChatMamba CRM, including **Add Data**, **Quick Add Data**, and **Import Data**.

## Add Data

**Add Data** allows you to add a single lead to the system at a time. To do this:

1. Go to [ChatMamba CRM](https://chatmamba.com/team-management)
2. Select **Source Leads**
3. Click **New Data → Add Data**

A dialog will be prompt. You can key in lead data corresponding to each column. You can optionally assign the lead to yourself, another member, or a distribution group.

## Quick Add Data

Quick Add Data is useful when you have a Spreadsheet file with thousands of leads, but you only wish to import some rows or columns. To do this:

1. Open your CSV/Excel/Spreadsheet file
2. Highlight the data you wish to add to CRM. Then copy them. **Do not** include a header row.
3. Go to [ChatMamba CRM](https://chatmamba.com/team-management)
4. Click **Source Leads**
5. Click **New Data → Quick Add Data**
6. Paste the data you have copied earlier and click **Next**
