ChatMamba CRM allows you to schedule the leads you want to distribute to your member over a period of time. This is useful if:

3. Click **Assign**
4. Select **Assign the leads later**
5. You can choose how frequent you want your member to receive the leads
    - Slow - 4 ~ 6 leads / day
    - Normal - 5 ~ 7 leads / day
    - Fast - 8 ~ 12 leads / day
6. Click **Assign Leads**

The system will schedule a time in future for each leads that you want to assign.
